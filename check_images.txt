4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:  All models performed equally well when classifying non-dogs.  Both the vgg and resnet were equal in classifying the beagle when it was rightsideup,
but both failed to correctly classify it when it was upside down.  I would select resnet however as the processing time for it to complete appears to be faster than vgg.
Though further testing may demonstrate greater deviations.
